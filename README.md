If you have cloned this repo to your local, you will need to complete a couple of setup tasks. Please see below:

1. Create two .env files: .env.test and .env.development.
2. Within these .env files, you will need to add PGDATABASE= with the correct database name for that environment.

- .env.test => PGDATABASE=nc_news_test
  -.env.development => PGDATABASE=nc-news

3. Create a .gitignore file if you haven't done so already. Within these, type node_modules and .env.\* (or as separate files .env.test & .env.development) which will insure that these files are ignored by GitHub.
4. Once you have created these files and inserted the PGDATABASEs, run npm install in your terminal.
5. Now you should all be setup to begin!
