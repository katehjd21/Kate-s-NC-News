# Northcoders News API

## Summary

This project focuses on building a REST API for the purpose of accessing application data programmatically.

It is designed to mimic the real world backend service, and therefore, has the capability to provide information to front end architecture.

Please click the link below for the hosted version of Kate's NC_News Project:

This link will take you to a directory which lists the endpoints accepted by the API. For each endpoint, there is a brief description, examples of accepted queries, and a typical response you might get from that endpoint.

NOTE: When clicking the link above, if you haven't got a JSON formatter extension installed, the data may be hard to view. Therefore, installing a JSON formatter extension to your browser can make data like this easier to view. This [JSON formatter on the Chrome Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en "JSON formatter on the Chrome Store") is a good one!
