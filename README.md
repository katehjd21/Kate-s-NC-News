# Northcoders News API

<!-- For instructions, please head over to [L2C NC News](https://l2c.northcoders.com/courses/be/nc-news). -->

If you have cloned this repo to your local, you will need to complete a couple of setup tasks. Please see below:

1. Create two .env files: .env.test and .env.development.
2. Within these .env files, you will need to add PGDATABASE= with the correct database name for that environment.

- .env.test => PGDATABASE=nc_news_test
  -.env.development => PGDATABASE=nc-news

3. Once you have created these files and inserted the PGDATABASEs, run npm install in your terminal.
4. Now you should all be setup to begin!
